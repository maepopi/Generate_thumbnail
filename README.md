# Introduction

This is a small batch script that allows you to drag and drop a GLB model and instantly generate a thumbnail rendering the object. 

Disclaimer : this is an old project made when I was still quite the newbie in Python coding. The code thus deserves a freshening up, and I know now that it's a bad practice to send and store a binary in a Github project. 

# Installation and use
1. Clone the repo
2. Put your GLB object inside the **"Input"** folder
3. Drag and drop the GLB on the **thumbnail_generator.bat** script
4. Your objec has been rendered and thumbnailed in "Output"
